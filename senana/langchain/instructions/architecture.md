Of course. As a professional software architect, I will provide a comprehensive system architecture and implementation plan for your text classification and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) application. This plan focuses on a modular design using the LangChain framework and exclusively local LLMs.

Here is the detailed architecture plan:

### **Architecture and Implementation Plan: LangChain-based ABSA with Local LLMs**

#### **1. Overview**

This document outlines the system architecture for a text analysis application designed to perform text classification and detailed Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The system leverages the LangChain framework and is built upon the core principle of using locally hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure data privacy, security, and operational independence from third-party APIs. The architecture is designed for modularity, scalability, and future extensibility.

#### **2. High-Level Architecture**

The system employs a pipeline-based architecture where input text flows through a series of discrete, well-defined stages. The core of the ABSA functionality is implemented as a multi-agent system, where specialized agents collaborate to perform the analysis.

#### **4. Technology Stack**

*   **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
*   **Core Framework**: LangChain
*   **Local LLM Hosting**: **Ollama** is recommended for its simplicity in setting up and serving various open-source LLMs via a local API. Alternatives include `llama-cpp-python` for direct integration.
*   **Recommended Models**: `Llama 3 8B Instruct`, `Mistral 7B Instruct`, `Phi-3 Mini Instruct`.
*   **API Framework**: FastAPI (for exposing the system as a service).
*   **Dependency Management**: Poetry.
*   **Testing Framework**: Pytest.

#### **5. Local LLM Setup and Integration**

1.  **Installation & Setup**: Install Ollama on the local server. Pull the desired models using `ollama pull llama3`. This will download the model weights and make them available through `http://localhost:11434`.
2.  **LangChain Integration**: The `src/llm/model_loader.py` module will abstract the connection. It will use `langchain_community.llms.Ollama` to create an LLM instance. Configurations (model name, temperature, etc.) will be read from `configs/llm_config.yml` to allow for easy model switching without code changes.

#### **6. ABSA Agent-based Pipeline: Architecture**

The ABSA pipeline will be implemented as a chain of three distinct, specialized agents. This approach improves accuracy and maintainability over a single, complex prompt.

**6.1. Aspect Extraction Agent**
*   **Responsibility**: To identify and list all distinct aspects, features, or entities within the input text that are being reviewed.
*   **Implementation (`src/core/agents.py`)**:
    *   **LLM**: A local LLM instance.
    *   **Prompt**: A precisely engineered prompt from `configs/prompts.yml` that instructs the LLM to act as an "Aspect Extractor." It will include few-shot examples to guide its output format.
    *   **Output Parser**: LangChain's `PydanticOutputParser` will be used to enforce a structured output (e.g., a list of strings), ensuring reliable data flow to the next agent.

**6.2. Sentiment Classification Agent**
*   **Responsibility**: To determine the sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) for each identified aspect, considering its context in the original text.
*   **Implementation (`src/core/agents.py`)**:
    *   **Orchestration**: This agent will be invoked iteratively for each aspect extracted by the previous agent.
    *   **Prompt**: The prompt will receive both the full original text and a single aspect as input. This contextual awareness is crucial for accurate sentiment classification. For instance: `"Given the review, what is the sentiment of the aspect '{aspect}'? Respond with only one word: Positive, Negative, or Neutral."`
    *   **Output Parser**: A simple `StrOutputParser` is sufficient, with potential validation logic to ensure the output is one of the expected sentiment labels.

**6.3. Aggregation Agent**
*   **Responsibility**: To consolidate the outputs from the preceding agents into a final, structured, and human-readable JSON object.
*   **Implementation (`src/core/agents.py`)**: This agent will be a deterministic Python function, not an LLM call. It will take the list of `(aspect, sentiment)` pairs and the original text to format the final output. It can also be extended to derive an overall sentiment or add metadata.

#### **7. Agent Orchestration**

*   **Framework**: **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** will be the primary method for constructing the analysis pipeline. Its declarative nature makes it easy to define the data flow between components.
*   **Data Flow (`src/core/orchestration.py`)**:
    1.  The orchestrator receives the raw input text.
    2.  It invokes the Aspect Extraction Agent chain: `prompt | llm | output_parser`.
    3.  The resulting list of aspects is then passed to a `RunnableParallel` that maps the Sentiment Classification Agent chain over each aspect. This allows for potential parallel execution.
    4.  The collected list of aspect-sentiment pairs is passed to the Aggregation Agent function.
    5.  The final, structured JSON is returned.

#### **8. Configuration and Deployment Considerations**

*   **Configuration**: All prompts, model parameters, and settings will be externalized to YAML files in the `configs/` directory. This decouples configuration from application logic.
*   **Hardware**: A machine with a dedicated NVIDIA GPU (>= 8GB VRAM) is strongly recommended for performant inference. 16GB+ of system RAM is also advised.
*   **Deployment**: The FastAPI application in the `app/` directory will serve the analysis pipeline via a RESTful API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/analyze`). The entire application, including Ollama, can be containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for portability and ease of deployment.

This architectural plan provides a solid foundation for building a robust, private, and effective sentiment analysis system. The modular and agent-based design ensures that the system is easy to maintain, test, and extend for future requirements.
